<h1>Sport Climbing</h1>

<h2>Origins</h2>

<p>Sport Climbing is a form of rock climbing that relies on permanent anchors fixed to the rock for protection, in which a rope that is attached to the climber is clipped into the anchors to arrest a fall, or that involves climbing short distances with a crash pad underneath as protection. Sport Climbing emphasises strength, endurance, gymnastic ability and technique.</p>

<h2>Indoor Climbing</h2>

<p>With increased accessibility to climbing walls, and gyms, more climbers now enter the sport through indoor climbing than outdoor climbing.</p>
 
<h2>Olympic Recognition</h2>

<p>Sport Climbing was scheduled to make its Olympic debut at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, and was previously tested at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics.</p>
